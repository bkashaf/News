News 3.0.0
==========

A News module for the Zikula Application Framework. From News 3.0.0 onwards the module is a native Zikula 1.3 module. This means it will not work in Zikula 1.2.x any more.

News 2.6.x will stay operational with bugfix releases for Zikula 1.2.x.
The News 2.6.x code has been imported into github without the commit history.
Sorry to say that most tickets were also not copied over to github and are lost.
