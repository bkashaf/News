News 3.x
==========

A News module for the Zikula Application Framework. From News 3.0.0 onwards the module is a native Zikula 1.3 module. This means it will not work in Zikula 1.2.x any more.

News 2.6.x will stay operational with bugfix releases for Zikula 1.2.x.
The News 2.6.x code has been imported into github without the commit history.
The tickets from CoZi will be imported into Github.
