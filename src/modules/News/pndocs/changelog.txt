Version 2.6.2
-------------

This is a minor bugfix release for the 2.6.1 release. There are some small enhancements as well.

The 2.6.x serie contains database changes: backwards compatibility fields have been removed. This is because of the compatibility with Zikula 1.3. Check your templates for usage of old redundant fields that are not there any more
(so now use cr_uid instead of aid, from instead of time, contributor instead of informant, hideonindex instead of ihome, disallowcomments instead of withcomm)

Summary of changes:

- Most important is that the picture uploading is more robust and final bugs should be gone
- You get more detailed feedback when an upload of pictures was not ok
- The picture upload directory presence and writability is being checked with ajax in the admin interface
- An htaccess file (restricting access to only images) is written in the picture upload folder when you click the checkbox to make this folder automatically. This to increase security.
- The pagevar description can be filled with the index page teaser text up to a specified nr of characters. configurable in the admin interface
- The Content module plugin has a configurable template in the settings. With this you can have a different look and feel of the News articles plugs in Content


Version 2.6.1
-------------

a bugfix version for 2.6.0
See all the tickets solved with milestone 2.6.1 and milestone 2.6.0 in the code.zikula.org project page.

Summary of changes:

- The templates for the Printer, rss and Atom themes are now up to date
- Picture uploading has been made more robust.
- The admin settings now checks with Ajax if the specified folder already exists and if it is writable.
- A checkbox is added to choose for creation of the upload folder.
- The error messages have been made more specific (too big, wrong extension etc).
- I switched to jpg files. I suddenly noticed that the thumbs were created in png, which gives much larger files. If you already have a large number of images, you have to convert them by hand, sorry about that  
- If you have ADD permission, the article becomes Draft if one of the pictures is not correctly uploaded.
- The allowed extension list (comma seperated) is now without spaces.

- Optimizations for less SQL queries when using shorturls and category based permissions (with a new switch)
- Some new permission options are added for the situation where you would normally require ADD permission:
