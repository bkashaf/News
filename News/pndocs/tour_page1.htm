<p>The News module provides the ability to add, edit and delete news articles published on the News lead page or displayed in the various blocks.</p>
<p>News has a simple, but effective workflow. Articles submitted by users become pending and admins can approve these articles. Furthermore articles can be published directly or have a publication date in the future. They will not be visible until the publication date has arrived.</p>
<p>News works perfectly with Scribite, that provides a nice wysiwyg editor for your articles. This eases markup of your article, inclusion of links, images, etc.</p>
