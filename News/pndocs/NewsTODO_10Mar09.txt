News TODO 10-Mar-09

New/Modify interface:
- Adjust New(user/admin)/Modify views with a right column for publicationoptions, status, category and Preview/Publish/Schedule buttons.
- Remove Publish/Preview dropdownlist for a seperate Preview/Publish button. Eases Direct publishing one click less. 
- Adjust publish button into Schedule when unlimited is not checked. 
- Add Calendar (JSCalendar or Proto/script one) to the Date selection of From and To
- Remove seconds from Date seletion and make minutes in 10 minute interval. An admin setting might be a good idea: (only days, only hours, default 10mins, 5mins, mins).

Featuring Articles:
- Make a admin setting, use default FeatureStory attribute yes/no
- Make a default FeatureStory attribute set to 0 if admin setting is on
- Make a FeatureStory block that uses the FeatureStory attribute to display them in a block, order ?

Admin interface:
- Add inline quick edit mode for title, publication options, status using ajax.
- Make sure categories are taken into account for the [ all(#) | published (#) | ... ] links. This needs the news_{property}_category form to be independent of property
- Optional place the actions below the title in a hidden state and showing when you hover over that article (instead of on the right), discuss first with Mateo

Article etc templates:
- Add the dateformatHuman modifier to the dates there with a nicevalue of 3 (or 4), so only within one day (or specified days as admin setting) display human dates
- Display all categories (so all cats in all cat properties like in news_user_index) with the article and article content.

dateformatHuman modifier:
- Extend the nicevalue with an additional value for Human readable dates with a specified nr of days, so up until nrOfDays ago display that otherwise format

Tickets:
DONE - Test the autonews and queue update procedure for those 764 tables.
- editing with ajax and scribite/shorturls etc to be solved.
